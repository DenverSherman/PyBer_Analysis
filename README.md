# PyBer_Analysis
An analysis on the ride-sharing company PyBer.
## Overview
2019 PyBer ride-sharing data is analyzed for trends between fare, city type, and number of drivers. Two datasets are merged to yield these results; one dataset was for metrics by ride, the other documenting city statistics. Once merged by city, statistics are calculated.

Here are the high-level summary statistics:

## Summary - Insights
Our analysis offers several key insights listed below:
* The majority of fare earnings occur in urban cities, hinged upon a large driver population. Further market penetration in urban cities would increase fare earnings.
* While rural areas represent only a portion of total fare earnings, they require far fewer drivers and drivers earn more. Higher earnings in rural areas can serve as marketing leverage in recruiting new drivers in new rural cities.
* There are more drivers than there are rides in the first quarter. Presumably, drivers could go months without seeing a customer. This could be a quality issue and a recruitment issue for new drivers.
